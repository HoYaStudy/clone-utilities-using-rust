The Rust project is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate in any venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter, and other online media. Project participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the project at the discretion of the project leadership.
